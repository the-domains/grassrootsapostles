  This site is still just an idea. I don't know where it will go. I don't know
  how the wind of the spirit will carry it. What's the basic idea? That the
  five-fold gifts of Christ are more ubiquitous than we think. There are
  apostles and prophets and teachers in some of the most unexpected places. They
  don't have titles. They don't have huge followings. They aren't all public
  speakers. They simply love in the way they were made to love. Their
  expressions of love look different. Apostles are not all the same. Just like
  fathers are not all the same.

This site is still just an idea. I don't know where it will go. I don't know how the wind of the spirit will carry it. What's the basic idea?

Jesus could have said, "I have set things up so that certain shoes get filled, for the sake of peace, joy and love to happen on the widest possible scale. Those positions will be filled naturally as you live in love and honor in community. Those positions are all positions of service - not control. They are father, mother, aunt, uncle, grandpa and grandma. These positions are all for the sake of children. They are all names dependent on - and given from - a child's perspective. You will do well to wear these roles with pride and serve from them in love and humility. Children will do well to honor these roles and learn as much as they can from your examples."
